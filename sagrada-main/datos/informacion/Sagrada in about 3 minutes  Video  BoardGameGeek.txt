kia ora Koutou and welcome to sagrada in about three minutes
it has a solo mode
it's a game for 1-4 players, playing time is medium and it's a pretty simple game
stained glass windows are artistic works of great difficulty
you are an artisan attempting to make your masterpiece but you are not alone
other artisans are competing against you
can you manage your supplies and tools and make the most wondrous stained  glass window?
you will mark the end of each round using a die
when 10 rounds are up the game is over and the winner is the player with the most points
points are scored by completing public goals as well as your individual private goal
drafting: there are a central pool of dice that players alternate selecting from
dice: Sagrada is all about the shiny bright dice
each player takes a window board, a secret objective and two double-sided tile cards
select one of the tile cards to keep and gain the number of tool tokens shown in the bottom right
then slide the title card into the window board
there will be three public goals and three tools
make sure to be familiar with them before you start drafting dice
each turn revolves around the dice draft
roll a number of dice equal to two times the number of players plus one
so for four players this will be nine dice
blue is the first player so they select one of the dice
play proceeds around the table to green
green selects two dice and play reverses back around to blue
the leftover die is used to mark the turn
the first die you place must be on an edge but from here there are restrictions on where you can place
a die the same color or number cannot be placed above or beside
so these dice cannot be placed by the
green three
if a square shows a number in it only a die matching that number can be placed there
so the blue two can go on a two
a white space can have any die placed in it that does not break the previous rules
and only matching coloured dice can be placed in coloured squares
so using the rules above only one die can be placed in the middle four space here and that is a red four
we draft a red three but this lets us use  one of the available tool cards
we pay one tool token to use the card and change the three to a four
subsequent uses of a tool card would use two charges
if you ever accidentally break the placing rules you must remove those dice
once 10 rounds are up scoring takes place
you score the point shown in the bottom left of the goal for each time you achieve that goal
so in this example we score it twice
your private goal will always be the total value of one color
and finally lose one point for each empty square
why would you like this game
sagrada is a puzzle game for people who love spatial puzzles
and the rising tension of having your  available placement options get more and more limited as the game goes on
and that's the best part of sagrada
looking at the draft options and realizing that you have put yourself in a bad position
or the triumph of getting a row exactly right to match a goal
the tool cards give you different options on how to manipulate the game
and only three are included each time you play
and well it's simply a pretty looking game those shiny dice are really nice
the best thing about this game is when it all works well and you have a wonderful looking high scoring completed window
however, despite the myriad of tools, tiles and goals in the game if you don't like the core gameplay of drafting and placement
none of the changes will make the game work for you
there's also limited interaction
while drafting to hurt other players can happen you're far more likely to draft for your own needs first
like the mechanics but wish the game had swords and spells try roll player
and for a different type of pretty dice  rafting game try noctiluca
sagrada one pretty puzzle
