TRANSCRIPCIÓN:
hey everybody this is me the undead
viking and this is sagrada sagrada is a
bag dice building game where you are
going to be trying to create
a stained glass window uh sagrada is i
guess the ground of basilica it's a very
very famous church which has some
awesome windows in it apparently
i didn't know about that until i
actually uh googled it and found out and
check it out that's really cool
uh but the game is a very very
light-hearted but very tricky puzzle
game in which you're going to be taking
dice that have been rolled and then
you're going to be drafting those dice
onto your stained glass window and
trying to create the best when you can
while satisfying your own personal
private goals and also some public goals
that are out there you also have access
to some tools that allow you to
manipulate the dice a little bit
and it's a heck of a lot of fun so why
don't i show you how to play and then
we'll come back here and i'll tell you
what i think
all right cool all right here we go this
is sagrada now this is as i said
a dice manipulation building bag
game i don't know it's got a lot of
different things going on but it is
relatively simple
relatively quick but it is super tricky
to play now let me show you how it is
done okay so
these are the cards we're going to start
with and also there are these player
boards i'll talk about these in just a
quick second
but the first thing you have to do is
that each game is going to be different
because each person
is going to get one of these random
private goal cards and they're basically
this is the different shades
red shades red yellow green blue and
purple and you get one of these random
this is
yours and yours alone however everybody
obviously knows that these are the
colors
uh basically you're gonna get extra
points for each time you use this
specific color so you're gonna be trying
to figure out ways
that you get that so let's just say uh
i'll you know i'll do it right away
see what i get uh yellow all right so
the yellow view
your secret one so you turn that over
you don't show it to anybody
everybody else gets one of these and
then there are these
public ones that you go after and each
one of these is a way to score points
you can see
six points so if you have um a row on
your
on your window that is one of each color
uh that's worth six points and everybody
can know that and then a column is worth
five
um the shade basically means the shades
are like the different numbers so as
long as the
the numbers are all different uh then
you know so on so forth so you earn
those points
that way and so there's you know and so
you go ahead and shuffle these up
and then you're gonna draw uh three of
these at random
and these will be three uh different uh
communal uh chances so let's see what we
get here um so this is
um deep shades so sets of five and six
will be worth two points
and let's see here and we're going to
get a row shade
variety a row with no repeated shades or
numbers basically
and then the last one is going to be uh
the columns alright
so those are our three and then
there are these tool cards uh the tools
cards allow you to basically manipulate
the dice in
in a certain way so let's just i'm going
to grab three and we'll just see them
see which ones we get here let's see one
two and three all right
and so of these let's see here we get um
copper foil burnisher move any one piece
in your window
uh ignoring shade restriction after
drafting place the piece
with out connecting to another piece
because normally you have to put the
dice next to each other
and then grinding stone after drafting
flip the piece to its opposite side
so we're going to go ahead and place
those three tools out like so
all right so now the one difference
between what i have and what's going to
come out
uh with when the game is uh comes out is
that each
person um is going to get a board that's
going to have several different
options as far as their windows go and
basically they're going to be easy ones
because you
you this is kind of spread out and
basically the white means you can put
whatever you want down
but everything else is like specifically
you have to put a purple here you have
to have a number four here and so forth
and the trick of the game is is that you
can't put either
numbers orthogonally next to each other
or colors orthogonally next to each
other so that can get a little tricky
so you'll like and so this is like an
easier one you can tell it's easier
because this little these little dots
down here
and so then like they blossom up to more
difficult ones
and so forth and so what's going to
happen and also in the back
you can see there's like that's you know
all
all different numbers there and then
like you know so and so forth so what
you'll do is you'll get a a board
that'll have several different options
for you
and then you can choose which one you
want to take so if you want to go easy
street
you can just go with this one and put
that down and that's what you're going
to be trying to
fill out and then you're gonna get
this little three there you're gonna get
three of these tokens that you're gonna
be able to use
to buy the right to use those tools now
the first time anybody uses a tool it
just takes one token to use it
the second time somebody else wants to
use it they have to spend two so
for the most part those aren't going to
get used a lot but if you have the extra
tokens
and you save them they're going to be
worth extra points at the end of the
round after the game so
even if you don't use them and like if
you go the route
of you know this big like the the
tougher ones that are that are tougher
to figure out
um you know with all the different uh
colors and so on so forth and you get
that the larger number of the the tokens
um if you hold on to them you know
they're gonna be worth extra points so
the way the game works is that whoever
is the first player you just determine
that randomly
um they're going to take so if we have
three players
um each person is going to get two dice
per round and so you draw
you you take dice out equal to the
number of players
uh times two plus one if that makes
sense
so with three players you're gonna have
seven so it's three times two six plus
one is seven so
one two three four
five six seven all right so that's what
we got and so
we didn't get any red um it doesn't look
like but we did get a blue we got a
green
we got a yellow and so what happens the
first round
is that you're gonna roll these dice and
then the first player does that
and they're going to pick one of those
dice and they're going to add it
to their board with the idea of one
trying to satisfy they want yellow so we
probably want to grab that yellow
die that's out there and they get to
place it on their board now the first
thing you place it you have to place it
on an
edge you can't place it in the middle
after that as i said you have to place
on the dice next to each other as you go
on so if we take
this two like so and you put it right
there bam now that probably isn't the
best decision i could have made because
you'll notice
that means that i can't place a die
there actually i'm going to take that
back because that's a very poor decision
basically because there is a 2 on that
spot
meaning that i have to place a 2 there
so if i have this 2
that would go there and that kind of
stinks that like i could i mean i could
if i wanted to if i wanted to spend a
point i could say
after drafting flip the piece the
opposite side so we can go
two and then we're gonna flip it over
and make it a
five and that's a completely valid thing
and now
if i want to get a 2 i can go ahead and
pick that as well
so let's just say the next person goes
they take this and then
and then the third person takes this
blue one and then the next person
uh and then it's a serpentine draft so
like
uh if you're familiar with that so
basically uh the third person goes the
last person goes in this round they're
gonna go twice they're gonna take that
one
and they take this and then it goes like
that and it gets back to me and this two
is available
and so why don't i i can just slide that
two onto that spot and that is
completely valid
now diagonal moves are allowed those are
considered to be next to each other and
so then they go
now you take this other die and you
place that basically
there's gonna be a turn track when the
game uh gets released
but you place that dive there on it'll
be like the turn track and that would
show that round one is done and there is
a ten
round game and so then you hand the bag
of all the dice
the next person and they're gonna take
seven more of these
and then let's see here one two three
four
five six seven wow i still haven't
gotten a red one that's crazy so whoever
like got boned and got like the red
like private one you know they're kind
of cursing their luck right now
so we're gonna roll this and still
because i went first now you're gonna go
last so the next person goes i'm just
gonna say let's see
they took that yellow you're like yeah
you jerk you took the yellow next person
goes bam
and so now it's my turn so now i can
start trying to maybe fill out
situations so here i can go i can go
with the four there and i could hit
the one here now i've actually set
myself up pretty well
um uh you know with uh
for regards to this one because look i
have a one two and a five if i can
somehow get a six
and like a three in that spot i'd be
able to go ahead and fulfill this
now and also you know it's like you know
and i've got a five down there so if i
can get a six
on the bottom row i mean i'd be able to
satisfy this as well and so you can kind
of see how the game evolves at this
point
and as you start using up the spots on
your window
um and you start getting constricted you
start getting that space and i should
mention
also it's very important that every spot
that you don't manage to fill
in uh you know of your little puzzle
your little window puzzle
at the end of 10 rounds it's worth
negative one points so
after all is said and done i'm not going
to go through every single round uh
you're going to figure out how many
spaces you have left
though and then if you didn't fill out
those are worth -1 points
you count up how much you've satisfied
your private one you kind of how much
you've satisfied as far as
uh the the communal options that you're
shooting for
what however many of these tokens you
have left are still are worth one point
and whoever has the most points
obviously
uh will be the winner of this game um
it is a lot of fun i love dice it is a
very colorful game
every time i brought this to my local
game store i played it everybody stopped
and stared and looked i think it has a
lot to do with these
super awesome cool colorful dice and
plus the the dice action the rolling and
the interactivity um you know it
plays in about a half hour it's one of
those perfect family games that you can
teach in about
five minutes and everybody's gonna learn
how to play it and know how to play it
and have a lot of fun with it but
let me talk more about that uh in my
final thoughts i just want to say i for
one
have always hated the terminology of
gateway game
anything can be a gateway game it
doesn't have to be a simple game it
doesn't have to be
a straightforward game it doesn't have
to be like you know some
you know like pillars of the earth or it
doesn't have to be some ticket to ride
my gateway game was arkham horror for
crying out loud
but i will say this i think sagrada is a
wonderful gateway game
um as i said when i brought this to my
local game store and i was playing it i
had more than a few people stop and like
ask about it
look at it check it out ask to play the
game try it out
and um i even had people that like
basically were like there to drop
off other people that weren't really
gamers per se and they were really
excited to play it and i had a couple
people like they wanted to know where
they could buy it right then right then
immediately and like i basically had to
say
you have to wait a little bit and back
on kickstarter and they were a little
disappointed but
i think i'm sure they backed it by now
but i
the thing is is that it has everything
that it needs to be that type of game
that type of family game it has really
really straightforward rules
um it affords a lot of communal thinking
because of the fact that like when
people are trying to figure which die to
pick you know it just
it's your nature to try to say you know
maybe take that one and put it there or
what have you
and it is something that kind of can
bridge the gaps if you will everybody's
playing games with dice everybody's like
you know
done like a football draft with the
serpentine thing you know i mean so it
has a lot of
uh things going for it that are just
really really
comfortable and like you know that that
comfort level or whatever
isn't isn't too imposing um my family
loves it we played a lot of it uh my son
maybe a little bit too young but both my
wife and my daughter really took to it
and had a great
great fun with it so um if you're
looking for one of those games that like
kind of bridges that gap and also is
that perfect
wind-up game for the big game or like
after the game night is winding down
just a quick game you can play right
before everybody goes home i really
suggest you uh
check out sagrada i don't think you'll
be disappointed uh if you have any
questions about the game ask away i'll
be happy to answer those to the best of
my ability
uh thank you very much as always for
taking the time to watch this video and
until next time i'm the end of viking
and i'm telling you
to have yourself one heck of an awesome
day all right bye
