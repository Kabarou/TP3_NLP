this is the Sagrada família the
construction started in 1882 and it's
still going strong today it's a monument
and patients
inside that you'll find the famous
stained glass windows and the best part
is that someone made a game about this
[Music]
[Music]
Sagrada is a dice drafting window
building window and this is the Spanish
word for sacred so I guess in here
God is a gambler and just look at those
beautiful dyes they are cubic they are
kind of sexy in a weird way they should
make a cathedral out of them
and this is how you play it
the first thing you'll do is randomly
pick a grid for your window you'll then
roll the dice and draft them with the
other players you can then start to
build your window by carefully placing
each day but there are restrictions
[Music]
thankfully there are tools you can work
with along with private and public
objectives this game feels like taking a
hot shower in the winter while trying to
fix a broken clock except your friends
are all there with you messing with you
clock sagrada has a very satisfying
sense of progression but the game does
feel repetitive after multiple plays the
private objectives could be more
interesting and the solo mode is
impossible but look at those dice they
look like vitamins fresh like a
watermelon so it takes three minutes to
learn 30 minutes to play and I think I
will keep it for a long time sagrada is
a game with a certain perfume it has
character and it's artistic
just like stained glass
